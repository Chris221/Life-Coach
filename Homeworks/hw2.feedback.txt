Good job with the ER diagram!

However, the IT reqs have issues:
- there are unanswered questions in the writeup; answer them!
- there are a lot of unjustified numbers and requirements; if you say 50Gigs,
  explain why? how did you come up with this number? client req? best
  practices? DoD req? NIST req? please verify every single item and make sure
  they are all properly justified.
